<h2>Menu Commands</h2>

<h3>File/Select Folder</h3>
<p>
Brings up a dialog box for selecting a directory in which the files to be printed reside.  The path is displayed 
on the line labelled "Path".
</p>

<h3>Options/Calibrate X</h3>
<p>
Brings up the Select Printer Dialog box.  After selecting the printer, a dialog appears with four edit boxes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of Characters to print in a line</li>
<li>Odd Page Offset (pixels) -- for double side printing</li>
<li>Even Page Offset -- determines the left margin</li>
<li>A Tweak value -- determines the right margin</li>
</ul>
<p>
A fixed width font is used.  The width of the page is determined and the number of characters is used to 
determine a width for the characters.  However printers don't print to the edge of the paper so margins are
needed on the left and right to make sure the text is readable.
</p>
<p>
The offset and tweak values are nominally in pixels but they are rather arbitrary values.  So one needs to try 
some values to see what it all looks like.  I usually try a value for the number of characters/line first.  If
the text is acceptably readable then assign a value to the Odd Page Offset and check the left margin.  The command
prints a page trial groups;
</p>
<blockquote>
Width: 95, xTweak: 130, xPage: 10200, xOffset 300, Pixels/Inch: 1200
123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
</blockquote>
<p>
The first group of lines displays the current settings.  The following groups use the current offset and 
compute a xTweak value based on the width of the character determined by the width of the page an the number of 
lines.  The xTweak value is computed for each group of lines.  Pick the best fit to the page, note the xTweak value
and insert it into the dialog box.
</p>

<h3>Options/Calibrate Y</h3>
<p>
Brings up the Select Printer Dialog box.  After selecting the printer, a dialog appears with three edit boxes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of Lines per Page</li>
<li>Offset -- determines the top margin</li>
<li>yTweak -- a value which controls the bottom maring</li>
</ul>

<p>
The offset and yTweak values are a bit arbitrary because they depend on the printer's pixel density.  Start with
the number of lines with zero for the offset and yTweak.  Run the operation and observe the top and bottom
margins.  Five pages are output.  The first page shows the results of the current values.  The next four pages show
the results of decreasing the height by one.  The line number is printed on each page so that the effect of the 
change can be determined.  The yTweak is printed on the second line of each page.  The yTweak value when placed
in the dialog box will result in the same output. 
</p>

<h3>Options/Edit Extensions</h3>
<p>
The program accepts wild cards but can only print text files.  The list of extensions acts as a filter of known
text files.  This command allows the list to be edited.
</p>

<h3>Help/Introduction</h3>
<p>
Brings up this Help File.
</p>

<h3>Help/About</h3>
<p>
Brings up the About Box that includes some information about the application. 
</p>

<h2>Tool Bar Commands</h2>

<h3><img src="Images/OpenFolder.jpg" width="16" height="15"> Select Folder</h3>
<p>
Brings up a dialog box for selecting a directory in which the files to be printed reside.  The path is displayed 
on the line labelled "Path".
</p>

<h3><img src="Images/Printer.jpg" width="16" height="15"> Print Dialog & Print File</h3>
<p>
Displays the Printer Dialog Box for choosing the printer and print attributes.  After the printer is chosen 
the files that have been chosen by the application from the information provided in the pprint dialog will be 
printed.
</p>

<h3><img src="Images/Options.jpg"> Options/Calibrate X|Y|Edit Extensions</h3>
<p>
A toolbar drop down list of commands. See above for comments about the individual commands.
</p>
<h3><img src="Images/About.jpg" width="16" height="15"> About</h3>
<p>
Brings up the About Box that includes some information about the application.
</p>

<h3><img src="Images/Exit.jpg" width="16" height="15"> Exit</h3>
<p>
Exit the application with no reservations.
</p>

<h2>Controls</h2>

<h3>Double Side Output</h3>
<p>
Check box if the files are to be printed double sided on paper.
</p>

<h3>Extension Valid</h3>
<p>
Check box to assert that the file is a text file regardless of its extension
</p>

<h3>Header is Output</h3>
<p>
Check box to assert that a header and footer shall be output on each page.
</p>

<h3>Search Subdirectories</h3>
<p>
If not checked only the specified directory will be searched for the specified file(s)s.  If checked all
subdirectories will also be searched for the specified file(s).
</p>

<h3>Tab Stop Spacing</h3>
<p>
Tab stops will be determined by the value in the edit box.  When tabs appear in the text the next character will
appear at the next tab stop after the current position. 
</p>

<h3>Specify Print Only After Date/Time</h3>
<p>
My favorite command:  Only print files requester that have been recently changed as determined by the date.
Actually the application does not know if they have been changed recently, it only prints the specified file(s)
which have a modified date after the date/time given.
</p>

<h3>Command Line</h3>
<p>
This is the place where the file(s) to be printed are specified.  Use wild cards '*' and/or '?' if warranted.
Separate file specifications with a space.
